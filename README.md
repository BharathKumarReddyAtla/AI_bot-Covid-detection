# AI_bot-Covid-detection

 We have developed a Machine Learning model that predicts the severity of the COVID of particular individual by analysis of the symptoms faced.
 
 Using python scripting language, we have coded the backend working of the application connecting the main and pickle file. 
 
 We have coded the application in such a way that simply answering the questions asked with YES or NO will give accurate prediction.
